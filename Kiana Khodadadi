Hi I'm Kiana but i prefer to be called Kay. I was born on November 15th 1990 in Iran and have studied master of biotechnology in University of Mazandaran, which I have to say I’ve got no  tendency to continue since I’ve found my passion and tallent in video makings. So I bacame a freelance selflearned videographer wich being trying to update my knowledge everyday. And I believe the best is yet to come.
